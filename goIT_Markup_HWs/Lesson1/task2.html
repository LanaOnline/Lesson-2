<p>Once you understand how to build web pages, you can start experimenting with dynamic features. Front-end development with JavaScript works in the browser, controlling tabbed panels, accordions, and image galleries as well as refreshing content without needing to reload the page. It’s a vast subject, but lynda.com has a good selection of JavaScript tutorials for beginners and intermediate developers.

Although JavaScript can also be used for back-end development, PHP is by far the most widely used server-side language. It’s used for communicating with a database, sending emails, uploading files, and much more. Of my two courses for beginners, Introducing PHP takes a formal approach, explaining control structures and showing how to email the contents of a contact form, whereas PHP for Web Designers shows how to make a website more efficient, including using a database.

Be curious
When I was learning, I frequented online forums <img src="http://lorempixel.com/400/200/"/ width="150"> in search of answers. I didn’t always find what I was looking for. In fact, the many unanswered questions prompted me to try to solve them myself. I didn’t always succeed, but I learned a lot from my failures.

That was in the days before Stack Overflow, where a wide range of programming problems are answered by the community, and users vote up or down depending on the quality of those answers. Don’t just take the top-voted answer. See why one answer is better than another. Maybe it isn’t. Work out why.
