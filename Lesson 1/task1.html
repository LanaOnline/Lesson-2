<p>Building a static <b>website</b> is relatively easy. But to <i>build</i> a rich, <strong>interactive</strong> web experience today takes much more code <em>behind</em> the scenes than you may have expected.
And while <u>becoming</u> a web <strike>developer</strike> may seem daunting, there’s a lot you can do to learn the ropes quickly and efficiently.
Here’s advice on how to become a web developer. I specialize in PHP for back-end development, but these tips are relevant no matter which aspect you’re interested in.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Set a practical goal
I became a web developer in response to a specific need. As editor of the Japanese-language version of the BBC’s international TV news channel, I didn’t have an advertising budget. So I bought a book on HTML, scrounged some space on a web server, and started building a bilingual Japanese-English website in my spare time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">That experience gave me the confidence to work on multilingual web projects for clients after leaving the BBC.

One project had a content management system written in classic ASP, a language that was no longer being developed, so I decided to convert it to PHP. I’m sure I would be horrified now at the spaghetti code I wrote, but I learned far more working on a real project than concentrating on theory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started
Even if you intend to specialize in back-end development on the web server—building content management systems with a database, handling file uploads, and so on—you need to understand how websites fit together. So it’s essential to begin with the two technologies that lie at the heart of web development: HTML to build the page structure and CSS to control design and layout.</p>
